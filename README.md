# bpdts-test-api
A node service which calls a heroku api

Built with Node v12.14.1

| command | does |
|---------|------|
| node src | start the service |
| npm run test | run tests with coverage in /coverage/lcov-report/index.html|

### Try it out

* http://localhost:8990/query?city=London
* http://localhost:8990/query?city=Budapest
* http://localhost:8990/query?city=DoƒÅba
* http://localhost:8990/query?city=Do%C4%81ba&distance=100

Default distance is 50 miles. Add '&distance=150' to change it

You can also pass **lat** and **lng** params:

* http://localhost:8990/query?lat=47.2550409&lng=-1.5401497&distance=100

### Notes

Would have liked to add eslint & jsinspect but out of time

I may have gone a little beyond scope here, but in general this is 
what the simple 'London' query would have to do anyway

The tricky part is the search & merge of the responses (all users and users returned for a city).
The all users query returns 1000 now but what if it returned 100,000?

In this case some kind of async JSON parser might be needed to prevent blocking.

I've put in an asynchronous forEach method to prevent blocking during the merge.
